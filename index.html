		<p>
			Pier is a new programming language that compiles to a custom VM platform.<br>
			It is statically but weakly typed, procedural, and very similar to C.
		</p>

			About the Project
		</h2>
		<p>
			The Pier project is an attempt to create guaranteed platform-independence by creating a platform that supports 3D graphics, audio, networking, and many other things natively. It doesn't allow FFI and, with a strong focus on GPU programming, attempts to be compatible with any graphics API an implementation might use as its backend. This project has been in development for 4 years.
		</p>

		<h2 style="text-align:center">
			Availability
		</h2>
		<p>
			An outdated version of the standard library is available on GitHub at <a href="https://www.github.com/gabecampb/pier">github.com/gabecampb/pier</a>. The compiler and VM are not yet released.
		</p>

			Roadmap
		</h2>
		<p>
			Access to all of the platform's features will be exposed through libraries over time.<br>
			Short circuit evaluation will be added and the compiler will be optimized for performance & cleaner code generation.<br>
			Compiler error messages will also be improved.<br><br>

			The VM's shader bytecode to GLSL translator is still a bit of a work in progress. Hopefully the VM will receive JIT support in the future for a significant performance improvement, but completion of a few subsystems of the VM (such as shader translation, CPU compute shader emulation) is taking priority.<br><br>
